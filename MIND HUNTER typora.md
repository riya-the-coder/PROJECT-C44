#     GAME: MIND HUNTER

---------------------

## CHARACTERS

-----

My game has both the characters PC and NPC. The PC will be the player and NPC will be the obstacles and emotions that I will be spawning accordingly. The PC will  be animated like a hunter who is trying to hunt his emotions which is the NPC. The NPC includes two happy emotions and two sad emotions and also the obstacles, all will be coming randomly.

## STORY

--------

 In this world,  it is very hard to find a people  without stress and depression. My game is about a person whose mind is totally filled with stress, depression and he is always lonely. In this modern world he is not able to find a person to share his problems with, as each and everyone is busy with their own problems and busy schedule of life. In this scenario, he wants to figure out the problems of his own. Thus he started to find and enjoy each simple and beautiful happy moments of life. But still he faces some sad moments. But mostly he tries to pick up the happy and crazy moments in life. Each day he used to have a check upon his emotions. But day by day when he checked his graph it shows that he is more peaceful. And thus he figured out his problems by hunting his own mind. And now he is successful in his life and enjoys the life a lot more. “LIFE IS TOO SHORT..LIVE IT HAPPILY”.

## GOALS

To hunt the mind all your own. Motivating a player to find happiness in his life. And making a person learn that our life or mind is a mixture of both happy and sad things. And equipping a person get away from the sad moments of life. As a whole the player will be hunting the mind.

## RULES

-------------

* Score increases when we hit the happy emotions.

* Score decreases when we hit sad emotions.

* There will be three lives.

* Game ends when player loses three lives OR when the score is less than zero.

* At the end of the game feedback will be printed accordingly to the score earned by the player.

  

## BALANCE

-----------

The game is designed in such a way that it is applicable for almost all age groups. At first it will be easy for the player to win. As the velocity of coming emotions will be less, it will be easy for the player to win. As level increases we will increase the velocity of coming emotions. And also the obstacles will be appearing in the game accordingly.

## ADAPTIVITY

--------------

We should make the game tough gradually. So that we should make the game difficult so that we can  increase the velocity of coming NPC. And also we are also adding three lives to make the game more fascinating. Obstacles will appear the game accordingly. Whenever the player touches the happy emotion the score of the player will be increased by 10. And when the player touches the sad emotions the score of the player will decrease 10. Thus it adds an extra thrill for the player to reach more score.

## CHANCE VS SKILL

----------------

There are some situations in game when the player touches the sad emotions by chance even though he tries his level best to skip from the sad emotions or from the obstacles. When the level increases according to that the speed of obstacles will also increase which will force the player to show his exact skill. In this manner it becomes quite challenging for the player to play the game.

## FEEDBACK

----------------

Towards the end of the game we will be providing a feedback which will be some kind of solutions according to the score earned by the player. We will be making the game attached with the database for this function.

for example:

If the score of the player is 20 , we will print a message “YOU SHOULD SHARE YOUR  PROBLEMS WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND”.

If the score is 100: “YOU ARE 100% HAPPY WITH YOUR LIFE”.
